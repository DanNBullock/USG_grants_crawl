    "### Previously\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we looked at how often a selected set of open-science infrastructure related terms showed up in [grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants) grant descriptions, and which agencies' grants they were showing up in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword list we used was one of our own making.  However, we are certianly not the first to explore this topic.  Indeed [Lee & Chung (2022)](https://doi.org/10.47989/irpaper949) looked precisely at the question of what keywords were most associated with this topic.  We can use their keywords and replicate our previous analysis using the expanded and empirically supported list of words.  This only involves minor changes to the previous noteook.\n",

    "The widget should allow you to select which terms to work with.  For the moment (i.e. early stages of this notebook) the interface is relatively rudamentary but the heatmap plot should feature a crosshair indicating which agency and term you are looking at.  The plot beneath that should inclde a list of the grant.gov IDs.  In many cases no grants are found meeting the criteria, and so a large text indicator should appear stating this.  However in the event that grants are found, they should be listed.  Currently the text scaling for this feature is rudamentary, and so if too many are found their font might be extremely small (future [modifications](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55729075/matplotlib-how-to-autoscale-font-size-so-that-text-fits-some-bounding-box) could adress this).  Additionally, the text elements themselves may be [capable of being hyperlinks](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/misc/hyperlinks_sgskip.html).\n",

    "In any case, we can also attempt to replicate this process and look at the value of the grants as well.  As before, this computation will take a moment.\n",
    "\n",

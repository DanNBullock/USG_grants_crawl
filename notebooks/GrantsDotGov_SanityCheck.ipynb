    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we replicated some of our previous analysis, which was done with a list of open-science terms of our own creation, with an emperically derived list of terms derived from [Lee & Chung (2022)](https://doi.org/10.47989/irpaper949).  While the reults look compelling, and at least appear to plausible relatie to our intuitions, we should always be skeptical of our results until we do some thorough sanity checks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll implement some sanity checks.  These will include confirming that the extreme ends of the term-matching distributions (e.g. many term matches vs no term matches) do indeed reflect the sorts of grants we would expect.  We'll also check to make sure that our quantative analyses of these descriptions actually return the sorts of results we would expect.\n",

       "the idea development award is intended to support new ideas that represent innovative approaches to prostate cancer **research** and have the potential to make an important contribution to the pcrp mission. the key components of this award mechanism are: **innovation**: **research** deemed innovative may represent a new paradigm, challenge current paradigms, look at existing problems from new perspectives, leverage unique study populations, or exhibit other highly creative qualities. **research** that is an incremental advance upon published data is not considered innovative. multidisciplinary projects are especially encouraged. impact: applications are required to address and provide a solution to one or more of the fy19 pcrp overarching challenges. the potential impact of the **research**, both shortterm and longterm, in addressing the fy19 pcrp overarching challenge(s) should be clearly described. highimpact **research** will, if successful, significantly advance prostate cancer **research** and/or patient care. preliminary data: due to this award&#8217;s emphasis on **innovation**, the presentation of preliminary data relevant to prostate cancer and the proposed project is encouraged, but not required. any unpublished, preliminary data provided should originate from the laboratory of the principal investigator (pi) or a member(s) of the **research** team. regardless whether preliminary data is included or not, applications should be based on a sound scientific rationale that is established through logical reasoning and/or critical review and analysis of the literature. to maximize the potential for impact, investigators are strongly encouraged to incorporate the following components into their study design where appropriate: authentication of proposed cell lines; statistical rigor of preclinical animal experiments and epidemiological studies; incorporation of experiments to assess clinical relevance and translatability of findings; and validation in patient cohorts. as such, the pcrpfunded prostate cancer biorepository network (pcbn) (http://www.prostatebiorepository.org) and/or the north carolina &#8211; louisiana prostate cancer project (pcap) (https://pcap.bioinf.unc.edu) are important resources to consider if retrospectively collected human anatomical substances or correlated clinical data are critical to the proposed studies. studies utilizing data derived from large patient studies that include longterm health records, biospecimen **repositories**, and preexisting **research** and that apply stateoftheart genomic and/or proteomic analysis, **bioinformatics**, and/or mathematical models to such data are also encouraged. new investigator category: the idea development award mechanism encourages **research** ideas from investigators in the early stages of their careers. the new investigator category of this award mechanism is designed to allow applications naming pis early in their faculty appointments, or in the process of developing independent **research** careers, to compete for funding separately from established investigators. all new investigator applicants must meet specific eligibility criteria as described in section ii.c, eligibility information. pis using the new investigator category are required to include a collaborator (or collaborators) appropriate to the application who has experience in prostate cancer **research** as demonstrated by a record of funding and publications in prostate cancer **research**. it is the responsibility of the pi to describe how the **collaboration**(s) will augment his or her expertise to best address the **research** question. multidisciplinary projects are encouraged, and multiinstitutional projects are allowed. each proposed study must include a clearly stated plan for interactions among all team members and organizations involved. the plan must include communication, coordination of **research** progress and results, and data transfer. additionally, multiinstitutional applications must provide an **intellectual property** plan to resolve potential intellectual and material property issues and to remove institutional barriers that might interfere with achieving high levels of cooperation to ensure the successful completion of this award. **research** involving human subjects is permitted under this funding opportunity; however clinical trials are not allowed under this funding opportunity. correlative studies associated with an existing clinical trial are particularly encouraged, provided they are determined to be no greater than minimal risk by the institutional review board (irb) of record and the u.s. army medical **research** and materiel command (usamrmc) office of **research** protections (orp), human **research** protection office (hrpo). pis seeking funding for a clinical trial are encouraged to consider submitting an application to the fy19 pcrp clinical trial award (funding opportunity number: w81xwh19pcrpcta). a congressionally mandated metastatic cancer task force was formed with the purpose of identifying ways to help accelerate clinical and translational **research** aimed at extending the lives of advanced state and recurrent patients. as a member of the metastatic cancer task force, cdmrp encourages applicants to review the recommendations (https://health.mil/referencecenter/congressionaltestimonies/2018/05/03/metastaticcancer**research**) and submit **research** ideas to address these recommendations provided they are within the limitations of this funding opportunity and fit within the fy19 pcrp priorities. the proposed **research** must be relevant to active duty service members, veterans, military beneficiaries, and/or the american public. the anticipated direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an fy19 idea development award will not exceed $600,000 for new investigators or $750,000 for established investigators. refer to section ii.d.5, funding restrictions, for detailed funding information. the cdmrp expects to allot approximately $35.52m to fund approximately 12 new investigator and 20 established investigator idea development award applications. funding of applications received is contingent upon the availability of federal funds for this program as well as the number of applications received, the quality and merit of the applications as evaluated by scientific and programmatic review, and the requirements of the government. funds to be obligated on any award resulting from this funding opportunity will be available for use for a limited time period based on the fiscal year of the funds. it is anticipated that awards made from this fy19 funding opportunity will be funded with fy19 funds, which will expire for use on september 30, 2025. awards will be made no later than september 30, 2020. for additional information, refer to section ii.f.1, federal award notices. the types of awards made under the program announcement will be assistance agreements (grants or cooperative agreements). the level of involvement on the part of the department of defense (dod) during project performance is the key factor in determining whether to award a grant or cooperative agreement. an assistance agreement (grant or cooperative agreement) is appropriate when the federal government transfers a &#8220;thing of value&#8221; to a &#8220;state, local government,&#8221; or &#8220;other recipient&#8221; to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the united states, instead of acquiring property or service for the direct benefit and use of the u.s. government. an assistance agreement can take the form of a grant or cooperative agreement. if &#8220;no substantial involvement&#8221; on the part of the funding agency is anticipated, a grant award will be made (31 usc 6304). conversely, if substantial involvement on the part of the funding agency is anticipated, a cooperative agreement will be made (31 usc 6305) and the award will identify the specific substantial involvement. substantial involvement may include **collaboration**, participation, or intervention in the **research** to be performed under the award. the award type, along with the start date, will be determined during the negotiation process. clinical trials are not allowed. new fy19 definition: a clinical trial is a **research** study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral healthrelated outcomes. **research** involving human anatomical substances, human subjects, or human cadavers: all dodfunded **research** involving new and ongoing **research** with human anatomical substances, human subjects, or human cadavers must be reviewed and approved by the usamrmc orp, human **research** protection office (hrpo), prior to **research** implementation. this administrative review requirement is in addition to the local institutional review board (irb) or **ethics** committee (ec) review. local irb/ec approval at the time of submission is not required. the hrpo is mandated to comply with specific laws and requirements governing all **research** involving human anatomical substances, human subjects, or human cadavers that is supported by the dod. these laws and requirements will necessitate information in addition to that supplied to the irb/ec. allow a minimum of 2 to 3 months for hrpo regulatory review and approval processes. additional time for regulatory reviews may be needed for clinical studies taking place in international settings. when possible, protocols should be written for **research** with human subjects and/or human anatomical substances that are specific to the dodsupported effort outlined in the submitted application as a standalone study. submission to hrpo of protocols involving more than the scope of work in the dodfunded award will require hrpo review of the entire protocol (dod and nondod funded). dod human subjects protection requirements may be applied to nondod funded work and necessitate extensive revisions to the protocol. applications that involve recruitment of human subjects must indicate the quarterly enrollment targets across all sites in attachment 5: statement of work (sow). successful applicants will work with usamraa to establish milestones for human subjects recruitment. continued support for the project will be based upon satisfactory progress in meeting the established milestones. refer to the general application instructions, appendix 1, and the human subject resource document available on the electronic biomedical **research** application portal (ebrap) &#8220;funding opportunities &amp; forms&#8221; web page (https://ebrap.org/ebrap/public/program.htm) for additional information. use of dod or department of veterans affairs (va) resources: if the proposed **research** involves access to active duty military patient populations and/or dod resources or **database**s, the application must describe the access at the time of submission and include a plan for maintaining access as needed throughout the proposed **research**. access to target active duty military patient population(s) and/or dod resource(s) or **database**(s) should be confirmed by including a letter of support, signed by the lowestranking person with approval authority. if the proposed **research** involves access to va patient populations, va study resources and **database**s, and/or va **research** space and equipment, va principal investigators (pi)s/copis must have a plan for obtaining and maintaining access throughout the proposed **research**. access to va patients, resources, and/or va **research** space should be confirmed by including a letter of support from the va facility director(s) or individual designated by the va facility director(s), such as the associate chief of staff for **research** and development (acos/r&amp;d) or clinical service chief. if appropriate, the application should identify the vaaffiliated nonprofit corporation (npc) as the applicant institution for va pis. if the va npc is not identified as the applicant institution for administering the funds, the application should include a letter from the va acos/r&amp;d confirming this arrangement and identifying the institution that will administer the funds associated with the proposed **research**. access to certain dod or va patient populations, resources, or **database**s may only be obtained by **collaboration** with a dod or va investigator who has a substantial role in the **research** and may not be available to a nondod or nonva investigator if the resource is restricted to dod or va personnel. investigators should be aware of which resources are available to them if the proposed **research** involves a nondod or nonva investigator collaborating with the dod and/or va. if access cannot be confirmed at the time of application submission, the government reserves the right to withdraw or revoke funding until the pi has demonstrated support for and access to the relevant population(s) and/or resource(s). refer to section ii.d.2.b.ii, full application submission components, for detailed information. **research** involving animals: all dodfunded **research** involving new and ongoing **research** with animals must be reviewed and approved by the usamrmc orp animal care and use review office (acuro), in addition to the local institutional animal care and use committee (iacuc) of record. iacuc approval at the time of submission is not required. specific documents relating to the use of animals in the proposed **research** will be requested if the application is selected for funding. the acuro must review and approve all animal use prior to the start of working with animals, including amendments to ongoing projects. pis must submit the institutional animal use protocol, iacuc approval of that protocol, and a version of the animal use appendix titled, &#8220;**research** involving animals.&#8221; allow at least 2 to 3 months for acuro regulatory review and approval processes for animal studies. refer to the general application instructions, appendix 1, for additional information. all projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the **reproducibility** and translational potential of preclinical **research**. the standards are described in landis, s.c., et al., a call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical **research**, nature 2012, 490:187191 (www.nature.com/nature/journal/ v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). while these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, samplesize estimation, and data handling derive from wellestablished best practices in clinical studies. applicants should consult the arrive (animal **research**: reporting in vivo experiments) guidelines to ensure relevant aspects of rigorous animal **research** are adequately planned for and, ultimately, reported. the arrive guidelines can be found at https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/ 622936arrive_guidelines.pdf. the cdmrp intends that information, data, and **research** resources generated under awards funded by this program announcement be made available to the **research** community (which includes both scientific and consumer advocacy communities) and to the public at large. for additional guidance, refer to the general application instructions, appendix 2, section k."

    "One thing to note right from the start is that there is a lot of text in this description.  Going back to the histogram we generated in the \"Open Science Overview\" chapter, this description is certianly in the right tail of that distribution with 750 words.  As such, simply due to there being more potential words to match upon, we might expect this description has a higher likelihood of meeting our inclusion criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing to note is that, although the word research shows up an _extreme_ number of times, it only counts as a single hit, so we needn't be concerned that resuse of a term is unfairly biasing our search algorithm results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, we can see that this isn't a grant which is _directly_ targeting open science.  Rather, it seems to be seeking submissions which are largely consistent with the values of open science.  In this way, this grant opportunity can be seen as an effort to fund open science (in that it seeks to fund the conduct of scientific investigations which are aligned with the principles of open science).  As such, it seems fairly reasonble that this grant would show up in our corpus.  That being said, we should also note that we shouldn't consider the _magnitude_ of the match (i.e. ten matching terms) as an indicator of how strong the grant's alignment is with the prinicples of open science.\n",

    "Several of our above observations, when taken togther, suggest a new metric which may be of interest to us.  We noted that, as a description grew to have mords, the likelyhood of one of those being a word in the keyword list grew.  However, for the particularly salient example (the number 2 top match), there were much fewer words, with still a substantial number of matches (9).  What if we created a metric which took in to account the number of matches, but normalized by the number of (unique) words.  Let's try this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also impose a minimum threshold for the number of words the description must obtain for this \"density\" metric to be computed.  Many descriptions have fewer than 10 words, which likely doesn't actually convey an informative description of the relevant target activities.  "

    "### Interacting with the plot \n",
    "\n",
    "The widget should allow you to select which terms to work with.  For the moment (i.e. early stages of this notebook) the interface is relatively rudamentary but the heatmap plot should feature a crosshair indicating which agency and term you are looking at.  The plot beneath that should inclde a list of the grant.gov IDs.  In many cases no grants are found meeting the criteria, and so a large text indicator should appear stating this.  However in the event that grants are found, they should be listed.  Currently the text scaling for this feature is rudamentary, and so if too many are found their font might be extremely small (future [modifications](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55729075/matplotlib-how-to-autoscale-font-size-so-that-text-fits-some-bounding-box) could adress this).  Additionally, the text elements themselves may be [capable of being hyperlinks](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/misc/hyperlinks_sgskip.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific to the plot itself, it's clear to see that the inclusion of \"research\" is throwing off the analysis.  This is likely because of how generic this term is. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How similar are agencies usages of terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "One question we might ask is if agencies are mentioning these terms in different ways--if the patterns of co-occurrence are _different_ for different agencies.  To answer this question we can take the co-occurrence matrix _for each agency_ and compare them to one another (thus resulting in _another_ matrix, this time agency by agency).  The proper tool for this is called the [cosine distance or cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). This measure provides a measure of distance between two collections of equally sized / shaped quantificaitons (in this case the [unrolled](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ravel.html) co-occurrence matrix.  Also, because we don't want the total number of grants for a particular agency to impact this analysis, we'll normalize the vectors (this is likely unnecessary due to how cosine distance works).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting the plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, what the coloration of the plot will indicate is the degree of similarity or difference in the patterns of term co-occurance for open-science related terms.  Implicitly, we might assume that a high degree of similarity would reflect agencies talking about open science topics in the same way, or focusing on the same aspects.  A high degree of difference would indicate using the terms in differing ways, potentially reflecting differing foci, or even different senses of the words being used (e.g. not in a sense related to open science).  Given that we are plotting _distance_ a value of 0 indicates overlap, and thus maximal similarity.  For this same reason, a value of 1 would the most extreme distance, and thus reflect maximal difference."

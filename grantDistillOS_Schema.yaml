# this is a LinkML schema for use with the ontogpt project https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt
# it's purpose is to provide the framework for distilling the Public Access / Open-Science characteristics of grants in a systematic and automatable fashion

# we will use examples provided here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt/blob/main/src/ontogpt/templates/
# lets start by initalizing the collection of classes
# note that we are NOT beginning with the w3id / linkml boilerplate for this initial draft
# UPDATE: Ok, fine, we'll include some of this information
